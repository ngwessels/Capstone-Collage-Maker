### Description

Name of Student: Nate Wessels<br>

From each dominant color it will get an image from online and replace that section with an image.<br>
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.<br>
Image Recognition API that will return what is consisted in the image. Will be used to get certain images from an image API<br>
Image API will get thousands of images that have specific dominant colors, and certain objects in image<br>
Will use React<br>
Javascript, SCSS<br>
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.<br>
Will add animations<br>
Will add firebase to save images to pull up from any device<br>
Will allow users to upload many of their own images to be used<br>
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?<br>
Firebase<br>
SCSS<br>
